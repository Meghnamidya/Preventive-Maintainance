<h1 align="center">PREVENTIVE MAINTAINANCE</h1>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p align="justify">Preventive maintenance is a proactive approach to equipment and machinery management that aims to prevent unexpected failures and maximize their operational efficiency</p>
<h2>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h2>
<ul align="justify">
  <li>The challenge is to create a predictive maintenance system that, using past data and sensor readings, can accurately foresee equipment breakdowns or degradation.</li>
  <li>The system should provide early warnings and actionable insights to maintenance teams, allowing them to schedule maintenance activities and prevent unexpected breakdowns.</li>
</ul>
<h2>OBJECTIVE</h2>
<ul align="justify">
  <li>Create a machine learning model that can evaluate sensor readings and past equipment data to forecast failure or deterioration risks.</li>
  <li>By implementing preventive maintenance, organizations can plan and schedule maintenance activities in advance. This allows for better resource allocation, including labor, spare parts, and equipment availability. Proactive planning helps minimize disruptions to operations and enables more efficient use of resources.</li>
</ul>
<h2>CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS</h2>
<p align="justify">Clustering Dataset: Because we are working with a large dataset, clustering was one of the obstacle that we faced. We utilized feature selection to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and then proceed with the clustering.</p>
<h2>FUTURE SCOPE</h2>
<dl align="justify">
  <dt>Predictive Analytics and Artificial Intelligence (AI):</dt>
  <dd>The use of advanced analytics and AI algorithms will become more sophisticated in predicting equipment failures. Machine learning models can continuously learn from new data and improve the accuracy of predictions, enabling more precise maintenance scheduling and resource allocation.</dd>
  <dt>Condition-Based Maintenance:</dt>
  <dd>Condition-based maintenance goes beyond time-based maintenance schedules and relies on real-time condition monitoring to determine when maintenance actions are required. Future preventive maintenance systems will rely on advanced monitoring technologies and algorithms to detect subtle changes in equipment condition and trigger maintenance activities accordingly.</dd>
